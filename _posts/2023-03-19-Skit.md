***6 turtles come in swimming***

Turtles: Nathan, Sahil, Bailey, Samuel, Everitt, and Jun

- 6 turtles come in swimming and organize in random order
- Rohit and Iris walk onto stage
- Rohit: OMG! My pet turtles are here. But I have a problem! I need to sort them by height because Petco needs to have a record. But, I don't know how to do that.
- Iris: Hmmm! I have an idea…Why don’t we use selection sort?
- Rohit: That’s a great idea Iris but do you know how to use selection sort?
- Iris: Not entirely but I know some people who might...

**Don, Hetvi,  and Evan enter**
 
- Don: Guys Guys! We heard you need help. We actually LOVE selection sort
- Evan: We know that sometimes selection sorting can be hard so we are going to walk you guys and the turtles who I know love algorithms through it.
- Hetvi: Yeah, let's do it. Selection sort basically works by continuously selecting the smallest (or largest) turtle from this unsorted column of turtles and moving them to the sorted area. This will happen by selecting the smallest or largest turtle and swapping it with the first turtle of the unsorted portion. 
- Don: This repeats until all the turtles are sorted by height. It’s important to know that there is a subarray which is already sorted and the remaining subarray that is unsorted.
- Evan: So right now, the order is Rohit, Sahil, Jun, Bailey, Samuel, Everitt, and Nathan. What we do first is we take Rohit's height which is 67 inches and then see if we can find any other turtle height that is smaller. We find that Nathan at 66 inches at the end of the array is the smallest and then set it as our minimum height. We swap Nathan and Rohit with Nathan being the only turtle in our sorted array.
- Rohit and Iris: OHHHHH! 
- Hetvi: Now we set Sahil at  as the next so-called minimum at a height of 71 and traverse the array to keep finding the next minimum. But the catch is that as soon as we find a turtle with a height smaller than 71, it becomes our next minimum.
- Don: For example, when we get to Bailey at 65 inches, he is our next minimum value.  As we keep going down the array, we don't see any other values smaller than 65 inches. Then we switch, Sahil and Bailey. Now Bailey is another turtle in our sorted array.

**Don and Hetvi help Iris and Rohit sort the turtles**

- Rohit: omg all my turtle besties are sorted.
- Rohit pats turtles on the head but when he looks away, they unscramble again. 
- Iris: Oh no Rohit! Look! The turtles unscrambled again! We can't trust them. We need an easier way to sort them. 

**Ellen comes in**

- Ellen: I can help you! Using java, we can write a code that can sort these turtles for us.

Hetvi wrote [this sample code](https://hetvit27.github.io/hetvitrivedi/collegeboard/2023/03/09/TurtlesSkit.html) that we are going to develop to fit this skit.
