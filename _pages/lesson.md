## Setup 
- Units 1-4 are roughly half of the exam
- The best way to learn it is through code flow which means integrating all key concepts into a code that you build upon 
- Start with the scavenger hunt quiz

## Lesson
- You are a teenager who has their license and wants to find a car to buy. When you go to the car dealership, you realize that there are many different things you have to keep track of. You have to keep track of the car brands you look at, the prices of the cars, phone numbers of different sales representatives, etc. To make it easy on yourself, you want to develop a computerized code that is able to sort through different prices, car brands, etc. The first step to doing this is through storing these different variables just mentioned as data types - primitive data types. You use variables to store data in Java. 
- For example, the price of a car can be stored as a double. The car brands you look and phone numbers can be strings. If you want to store whether you like a car or not, you can store that information as a boolean data type. 
- Now that you have data and variables declared, you can also compare prices of different cars through expressions and assignment statements. There are operators like the modulo operator where the remainder is computed or there's division and multiplication. If you ever want to compare car prices, you can set up a code with scanner input which is also a very common with consoles.
- Start Hack 1.
